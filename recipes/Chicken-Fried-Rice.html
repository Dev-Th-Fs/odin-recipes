    <p>This is a quick and easy recipe for chicken fried rice that I make when I have leftover roast chicken and cooked
        rice. I add some veggies and a few pantry staple spices for a flavorful family dinner that's perfect when you're
        short on time and groceries!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced green onions, white and lighter green parts</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 cups cold cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat canola and sesame oils in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrot and 1/4 cup green
            onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Stir in garlic powder and ginger and cook for 2 minutes.
            Stir in rice, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring only once or twice, until rice is lightly browned, about 4 to
            5 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas; cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Push rice mixture to the sides of the pan, creating a circle in the middle. Add butter to the center of the
            pan. When melted, pour eggs into the center. Cook eggs, stirring often, until almost set, about 3 minutes.
            Stir eggs into the rice mixture. Stir in soy sauce and rice vinegar; cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately topped with Sriracha mayo and green onions.</li>

    </ol>
