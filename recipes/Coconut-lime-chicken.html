    <p>This saucy coconut lime chicken is a nice way to switch up the usual dinner routine. It's super customizable; and
        is excellent when served over basmati or jasmine rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (13 2/3 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
        <li>tablespoon honey, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season both sides of the chicken thighs with paprika, salt,
            onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. Place chicken in pan and sear until browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
            Flip chicken over and cook until browned, 6 to 8 minutes more. Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add onion, garlic, and ginger to the skillet. Cook until onion is softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes,
            stirring often. Add in chicken stock, coconut milk, honey, Sriracha, and soy sauce. Bring mixture to a
            simmer, and reduce heat to low. Cook sauce for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl or measuring cup, stir lime juice and cornstarch together. Stir cornstarch mixture and lime
            zest into the pan, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce begins to thicken, 5 to 8 minutes. Taste
            sauce, and adjust salt, pepper, honey and Sriracha amounts as needed. Add chicken thighs and any accumulated
            juices back to the skillet. Continue cooking until chicken is heated and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes
            more.</li>
        <li>To serve, sprinkle fresh cilantro over the chicken, and squeeze more fresh lime juice over the top if
            desired. Sprinkle with toasted coconut, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
